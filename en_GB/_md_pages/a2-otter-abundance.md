One of the actions undertaken by the Czech national Otter Management
Plan is population surveillance and mapping. Estimates of otter numbers
in selected core areas are utilised to obtaining various additional
information. These include otter population density, abundance,
structure and development of the population trend in these areas.
Information about otter population density will also be used for
calculating the of amount of otter-caused damages for which Czech state
pays compensation.
