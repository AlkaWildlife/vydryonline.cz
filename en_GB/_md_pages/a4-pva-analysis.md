Population viability analysis (PVA) is a species-specific method of risk
assessment frequently used in conservation biology. It is traditionally
defined as a process that determines the probability that a population
will go extinct within a given number of years. A basic model,
predicting the probability of extinction of the Czech otter population,
has been already prepared within the previous ALKA Wildlife research
project and will be now updated and improved based on newly acquired
data. The more precise input data are, the more reliable outcomes
(scenarios) the model produces.
