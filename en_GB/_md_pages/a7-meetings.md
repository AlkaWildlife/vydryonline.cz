Meetings with Czech managers from road construction authorities will be
organised in order to present the map of otter road deaths and,
accordingly, highlight road sections where mitigation measures should be
implemented with the highest priority. Also, the information on the new
map app vydrynasilnici.cz will be provided along with the updated
methodology “Otters and Traffic: a Handbook to Reduce the Negative
Impact of Road Traffic on Otters”.
