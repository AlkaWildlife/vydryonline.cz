Dead otters are a valuable resource for population studies and there is
great value in collecting carcases for post-mortem studies. Since 2008
ALKA Wildlife coordinates otter mortality research in the Czech
Republic. About 50 carcasses are recorded yearly; each of which is
subject to detailed investigations. Autopsies are undertaken in a
standard manner according to the methodology recommended by the IUCN
Otter Specialist Group (Simpson 2007, 2011). The investigated factors
are: cause of death, animal age (according to body size, condition,
cranial sutures, incremental teeth lines), animal sex, reproduction
status, condition, macroscopic check of all body organs, biometry,
stomach content, parasitology (analysed by the Czech University of Life
Sciences) and mercury content (analysed by University of Pardubice).
Further specific analyses (gas chromatography for presence of poison,
x-ray examination) are performed in cases where illegal killing is
suspected.
