A detailed analysis of the conflict between the economic interests of
fisheries and otter conservation in the Czech Republic will be provided
in order to propose measures for the conflict mitigation. Various
economic measures, such as otter-presence funding, improvement of an
otter-induced damages compensation system, and legal amendments should
be evaluated as possibilities to improve the current situation.Â
