We have just launched a new project, targeted at the implementation of
the Otter management plan. Otter is a beautiful mustelid carnivore, yet
it is being poached in the Czech Rep. Also, otters are frequently killed
on roads. We will try to target both issues within our project. Welcome
to the project website!
