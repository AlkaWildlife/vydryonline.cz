Dozens of otters living in the Czech Republic are killed by poachers
every year, according to a survey carried out by ALKA Wildlife
organisation. The organisation has warned that if the negative trend
continues, the otter population in the Czech Republic would be seriously
threatened.

The 32 cases of otter illegal killing recorded in years 1992-2014.
However, only a small number of cases is revealed and investigated, real
numbers are much higher – estimations are that dozens of otters are
illegally killed every year.

Last case of otter illegal killing comes from December 2015. Seriously
wounded (shot) otter has been found near Mníšek in PLA Třeboňsko at the
end of December. The otter was immediately taken to a rescue station,
even so died of massive internal bleeding. It was probably shot several
days before and suffered for a long time.

A number of other protected species, such as birds of prey, also fall
victim to poachers. Killing a protected animal is a criminal offense
punishable by up to three years in prison. However, only a small
percentage of the cases are successfully investigated.
