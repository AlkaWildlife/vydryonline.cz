Dead otter was found in Oleksovice near Znojmo. Autopsy made by Václav
Beran from ALKA Wildlife revealed, that the animal was seriously wounded
by shooting and then hit by car. The otter was shot by 11 small shots
and must have been wounded and suffering for days before finally,
exhausted and confused, got into collision with a car, far from any
stream or river.

As we have already published, this is not the first case of otter
illegal killing in the Czech Republic, we estimate about dozens of otter
illegal killing cases every year. However, only small proportion of
these cases are revealed, recorded and investigated by the Police. ALKA
Widllife therefore already tightened cooperation with Ministry of
Environment and Police Wildlife Crimes Forces – see our previous
statements at

The poachers come of the owners of ponds and fishermen who see otter as
a rival predator who hunts their fish stock. “*Although otter is our
native predator, fishermen very frequently do not accept that and want
otter to be eradicated again, due to damages on fish stock. Even though
the Czech Republic pays compensation for damages caused by otters*,”
says Katerina Poledníková from ALKA Wildlife. “*ALKA Wildlife activities
therefore also focus on decreasing the conflict between otter and
fishermen, by doing the assessment of damages caused by otters and by
development of technical equipment for prevention of otter damages.*”
